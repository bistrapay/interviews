# Account manager

You are an account manager at Bistrapay who also happens to be our frontend developer. 
As Bistrapay grew we realized we needed to develop a frontend application to make management of people easy for accounting purposes.

You are tasked with developing our React client-side application with the following requirements:

1. Create a page that has a button that loads a user from https://randomuser.me/ every time it's clicked.
2. Add, `account_balance` attribute to each newly loaded user.
3. Delete the `info` property on each newly loaded user.
3. Store the user profile.
4. Create another page where we can see a list of all the loaded users and clicking on a single user shows the user's profile details.
5. Create a final page where I can increase or reduce the amount on their `account_balance`

The styling of the pages are is not so important.

It is recommended you don's spend more than 2 hours on this task.

Please host the application on a publicly available server and share the git repo link.
